# EDSML group project

## Seismic imaging revision assignment

The purpose of this exercise is to provide you with a structured way to consolidate your understanding of seismic imaging. We have been through a lot of content quickly in 2.5 days and this exercise offers you an opportunity to think more deeply about these concepts to help you prepare for the assessed quiz next week (on Fri 24th Jan). You could rush through the activity quickly in a couple of hours just copying and pasting from the notes- but I encourage you to use this time to really make sure you understand things. Talk things through with your group as well as the GTAs who will host drop-in sessions. I will provide you with feedback on your submissions by Tuesday 21st Jan, to help you prepare for the assessed quiz. At the bottom of this notebook you will find three example questions to show you the format of the assessed quiz. Please answer these questions and you will receive feedback on these too.

## Materials

You are provided with the following materials:
- a question note (EDSML_group_project 1);
- Thebe_small2.sgy which you can find in the 'data' folder here**- https://imperiallondon-my.sharepoint.com/personal/psalah_ic_ac_uk/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fpsalah%5Fic%5Fac%5Fuk%2FDocuments%2Fdata%2DBecky%2Dexercises&ga=1 

## Deliverables
 written answers to questions in a Jupyter notebook (please also include figures from the lecture notes or other referenced sources), coding to view seismic and calculate attributes
Assignment set: 10 am 16th Jan
Assignment to be submitted: 12 noon 17th Jan


#### Submission process:

As part of your group project, it's crucial that we maintain an organized and efficient submission process. To ensure this, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- One Submission Per Group: Each group is required to submit only one answer. It's important that you collaborate and consolidate your work within your group to finalize a single, representative notebook.

- Please include your group name, your answers in th email and send it to:

rebecca.bell@imperial.ac.uk

psalah@imperial.ac.uk

- Feedback Process: After the submission deadline, Becky will review the submitted notebooks and provide feedback. It's essential to submit by the deadline to receive timely feedback.



#### Ancillary files

If your code or answers depend on additional files, such as images, photos, or small data files, then make sure to include these in your submission as well. There is no need to include the Thebe_small2 data file
