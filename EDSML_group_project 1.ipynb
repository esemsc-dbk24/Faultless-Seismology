    "The purpose of this exercise is to provide you with a structured way to consolidate your understanding of seismic imaging. We have been through a lot of content quickly in 2.5 days and this exercise offers you an opportunity to think more deeply about these concepts to help you prepare for the assessed quiz next week (on Fri 24th Jan). You could rush through the activity quickly in a couple of hours just copying and pasting from the notes- but I encourage you to use this time to really make sure you understand things. Talk things through with your group as well as the GTAs who will host drop-in sessions. I will provide you with feedback on your submissions by Tuesday 21st Jan, to help you prepare for the assessed quiz. At the bottom of this notebook you will find three example questions to show you the format of the assessed quiz. Please answer these questions and you will receive feedback on these too.\n",

    "- One Submission Per Group: Each group is required to submit only one answer. It's important that you collaborate and consolidate your work within your group to finalize a single, representative notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Please include your group name and your answers in the email, cc-ing all members of the group and send it to:\n",

    "rebecca.bell@imperial.ac.uk\n",
    "\n",
    "psalah@imperial.ac.uk\n",

    "#### Ancillary files\n",

    "If your code or answers depend on additional files, such as images, photos, or small data files, then make sure to include these in your submission as well. There is no need to include the Thebe_small2 segy file. Please ensure you run all cells before submission."
